```

### Build Process
1. **Basic Build**: `make` - Builds extension with basic functionality
2. **ADBC Build**: `make release-snowflake` - Builds ADBC driver + extension
3. **CI Build**: Automated multi-platform builds via GitHub Actions

### Dependencies
- **OpenSSL**: For secure connections (via vcpkg)
- **Arrow ADBC**: For database connectivity (planned)
- **Go**: For building ADBC driver (planned)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 1-2 weeks)
1. **Complete ADBC Integration**
   - Add ADBC submodule
   - Implement ADBC driver building
   - Add basic connection functionality

2. **Re-enable Testing**
   - Fix existing test issues
   - Add comprehensive test coverage
   - Enable tests in CI pipeline

3. **Documentation**
   - Update README with current functionality
   - Add development setup instructions
   - Create API documentation

### Short Term (Next 1-2 months)
1. **Core Snowflake Connectivity**
   - Implement `snowflake_attach()` function
   - Add authentication support
   - Basic query execution

2. **CI/CD Enhancement**
   - Add deployment pipeline
   - Automated release process
   - Performance testing

### Long Term (Next 3-6 months)
1. **Advanced Features**
   - Query optimization
   - Bulk data transfer
   - Advanced authentication methods

2. **Production Readiness**
   - Performance optimization
   - Error handling improvements
   - Security hardening

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations
1. **Tests Disabled**: Tests are currently disabled in CI due to incomplete implementation
2. **ADBC Not Integrated**: Arrow ADBC driver is not yet integrated
3. **Limited Functionality**: Only basic scalar functions are implemented

### Technical Debt
1. **Error Handling**: Need comprehensive error handling
2. **Logging**: Need proper logging infrastructure
3. **Configuration**: Need flexible configuration management

## Contributing

### Development Setup
1. Run `./scripts/setup_dev.sh` to set up development environment
2. Use `make release-snowflake` for ADBC-enabled builds
3. Run `make test` to execute tests

### Code Standards
- Follow DuckDB coding standards
- Use C++17 or later
- Include comprehensive tests for new features
